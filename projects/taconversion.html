    <h1>Toyota Tacoma Camping Bed Conversion</h1>
    <p class="project-summary">As a final project for our SolidWorks course, we worked in a group of 4 to create a 3D 
      CAD model of a camping bed conversion for a Toyota Tacoma.</p>

    <img src="../images/project1.jpg" alt="Project image" class="project-detail-img">

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>We based the entire model off of accurate dimensions of the bed of a Toyota Tacoma that one of the members 
      of our group owned. This was in hopes that he could then go and build the bed conversion that we designed in SolidWorks.</p>

    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>Assigned different parts of the model to group members, thoise being truck bed, tailgate, cab cover with 
      windows, hinges, compartments, frame, drawers, sliders, screws. I was in charge of designing the frame, 
      drawers, sliders, and screws. I used a three part drawer slider as reference for my design.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Desinged the overall structure of the insert that would sit in the bed, the drawersw with the 3 part sliders,
      the handles for the drawers that would not stick out and interfere with the tailgate, but be built into the drawer, 
      and the screws to put everything together.</p>
