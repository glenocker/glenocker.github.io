    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>An ongoing personal engineering project involving the full mechanical and interior restoration of a 1983 
      Porsche 944. The objective is to rebuild a non-running vehicle to be fully operational, with a fresh 
      interior, while minimizing costs through self-directed research, diagnostics, and part sourcing.</p>

    <h2>Rebuild Process</h2>
    <p>After purchasing the non-functional vehicle with a friend, we inspected all the major mechanical components, 
      identifying issues in the engine and drivetrain systems. I created a spreadsheet to track all costs of parts 
      already purchased, as well as a prediction of the parts we might need. Using manuals and technical forums, 
      we diagnosed engine performance issues, sourced components at 12% below market value, and documented the 
      restoration process for future reference. We also planned an interior redesign focused on maintaining 
      authenticity while upgrading materials for durability.</p>

    <h2>Current State</h2>
    <p>To date, the project has progressed through diagnostic and component rebuilding phases. We have restored 
      the ignition coil, starter motor, and fuel system components. With the engine turning over but not starting, 
      we tested compression and found that all the cylinders are below the desired value, with two of them 
      significantly worse than the other two. We decided that we will pull the engine out and rebuild it with new 
      components. This decision was made with the thought in mind that rebuilding an engine would teach us a great 
      deal about its internals and help us better understand how the components interact with one another. We aim 
      to complete the full restoration within 24 months. This project has deepened my practical understanding of 
      mechanical systems, engine design, and hands-on problem-solving, helping to put my academic knowledge into 
      practical use.</p>
