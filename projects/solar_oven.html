    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Led a six-member team to design and construct a cost-effective solar oven capable of converting 
      solar radiation into usable thermal energy for cooking. The goal was to achieve the highest internal 
      temperature while following constraints and remaining as close to the predicted temperature as possible. 
      This was done by applying thermodynamic and heat transfer principles to optimize performance.</p>

    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>We began by calculating the theoretical maximum internal temperature of the oven using box dimensions, 
      solar irradiance data, and heat loss equations. We used cardboard, aluminum foil, and clear 
      plastic as primary materials to minimize costs and maximize reflectivity and insulation. I coordinated 
      team meetings, delegated tasks, and ensured we were on track to finish on time. The final oven design featured reflective 
      inner surfaces to concentrate sunlight onto a dark walled inner chamber, with a clear plastic cover to trap heat 
      and prevent convective losses. Testing involved monitoring temperature changes under varying sun angles and 
      weather conditions, as well as using a thermal camera to detect any leaks in the oven's structure.</p>
